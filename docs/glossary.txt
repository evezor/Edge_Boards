system/collective/something: a bunch of boards hooked up and hopefully working.

Map: the configuration data that maps foo to function calls on some board. Previously called the dictionary. 


Board guid: unique id across all boards
Board part number: Same value for all of the boards that are the same.
Board ID: number assigned to a guid for canbus protocol 
Board name: unique across the system.  Human puts it into the IDE/json to reference a board in the collective. 

Thing Joe said – provision? : the process of associating individual boards to their names defined in the map.  Some sort of process where a human tells the system what board is what.  “press the button on SwitchABC”  

foo: the butterfly that causes butterfly messages to be sent. (either over the bus or locally).  event?  trigger? self fulfillment.

butterfly messages: the point of all this.  What the IDE defines, not the heart beat and map deployment.

manifest: info about the board.  What it is. Maybe just a part number, maybe also a description, version, manufacture.  It is used to help build the map by providing an inventory list to the IDE, and later to provision. 

Inventory time: defining the set of boards that will make up a system.
IDE time: when a human is using the IDE to do things.
Provision time: when a human is helping the system figure out what is what
Boot time: When a board is turned on or reset, the process untill it functional.
Run time: onece it is functional.
